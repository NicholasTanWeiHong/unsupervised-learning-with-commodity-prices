# Unsupervised Learning with Commodity Prices

## Description

This project attempts to utilize methods in Unsupervised Learning to deduce and infer similarities in the trading behaviour of commodity contracts. Specifically, it uses Hierarchical Clustering and K-Means Algorithms to investigate if different commodity contracts may be clustered into reasonable sub-groups.
